# HeartDiseasePrediction
Python project testing the accuracy of various models on predicting if a patient has heart disease using the kaggle dataset at: https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci

The project begins by checking that all dependencies are updated and working correctly.

The data is then loaded in and checked.

Next, we prepare the two selected models: Logistic Regression and K Nearest Neighbors

After implementing both models and checking the accuracies, we see that KNN is slightly more accurate than logisitic regression.
